## Overview

This is a fully interactive e-commerce product page I built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The page includes dynamic cart functionality, product image previews, and a responsive design that adapts beautifully across desktop and mobile.

I built this project as part of my frontend engineering learning journey, with the goal of practicing real-world patterns and improving how I handle UI/UX details.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

**Built with**

- ‚öõÔ∏è React 18 ‚Äì component-based UI

- ‚ö° Vite ‚Äì fast build tool & dev server

- üìò TypeScript ‚Äì type-safe state & props

- üé® Tailwind CSS ‚Äì responsive, utility-first styling


### What I learned

This project reinforced a lot of practical frontend skills for me:

- Handling state management with React hooks (`useState`) to track cart count and menu toggles.  
- Passing state between components cleanly in TypeScript.  
- Using Tailwind utilities for responsive design instead of writing custom CSS.  
- Improving UX details:
  - Making sure the cart doesn‚Äôt overflow on mobile.
  - Adding a dark overlay for better focus when the mobile menu is open.

### Continued development

Areas I‚Äôd like to explore next:

- Add a lightbox modal for zooming product images.

- Persist cart items with localStorage.

- Replace hardcoded product data with a mock API.

- Experiment with context API or Zustand for global state instead of prop drilling.

### Useful resources

- Tailwind CSS Docs ‚Äì super helpful for responsive utilities.

- React Docs ‚Äì for clarifying component patterns.

- TypeScript Handbook ‚Äì to avoid type errors when passing props.

Thanks to AltSchool Africa and my personal practice projects for giving me the structure to keep building and refining my frontend skills. Also, a big shoutout to open-source docs and tutorials that made solving tricky UI/UX details (like the mobile menu animation) much easier.
